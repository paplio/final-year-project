# Final Year Project

## This repo will host all server side work of the project.
The client-side and server-side will be talking to each other with a Flask backend and OkHTTP on our Android app (mostly!)



For server functionality, download the deepspeech model and scorer from the deepspeech releases page [here](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/releases).
(Store these in the same folder as subtitle-ing.py!)
